Polygon Build
=============

A build environment for building Codeforces Polygon contest.

Description
-----------

The Codeforces Polygon system can create contest packages. The package need to be built first before it can be used at... say... the CMS system. Unfortunately Codeforces is mainly a Windows camp, and so it can be quite hard to build it on Linux. This image should have all, if not most dependencies installed in order to build the contest package.

Usage
-----

Run `./compile.sh contest` where `contest` is the extracted folder of the contest package.
